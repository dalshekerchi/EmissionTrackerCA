# EmissionTrackerCA
EmissionTrackerCA is an application made with python that takes a look at the negative repercussions of climate change in different areas in Canada. The application prompts the user to input a year that showcases three maps. One that shows the raw CO2 equivalent output from each province in a given year, one that shows the difference in CO2 equivalent output from each province for a given year compared to 1990, and one that shows the difference in daily mean temperatures for each weather station for a given year compared to 1990. The user is also able to select a weather station, which will then create a graph comparing the CO emissions of the province and the temperature over a period of time.

The application uses Tkinter to make a user-friendly interface, where the user can narrow the search for the station by using a search bar to create an interactive Plotly graph presenting carbon dioxide levels and temperature anomalies respectively.


## Built with
* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) - Used to make the GUI
* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) - Used to make the graphs and maps
* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Used for image manipulations
