# EmissionTrackerCA
EmissionTrackerCA is a GUI application developed using python that studies the repercussions of greenhouse gases in Canada. Data wrangling is used to process the temperatures gathered from Environment Canada datasets. Three maps that examine how carbon dioxide emissions affect provinces differently made using Plotly can be obtained when the year desired is inputted. 

EmissionTrackerCA also uses the Tkinter library to create a user-friendly interface allowing the user to narrow their search for a weather station. The weather station is then used to investigate the relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and temperature by creating an interactive dual-axis graph.

## Built with
* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) - Used to make the GUI
* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) - Used to make the graphs and maps
* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Used for image manipulations
